"added" to the stack get placed under newer items placed on the stack. The item that was placed last will be on the top.
The item that was placed first will be placed at the very bottom of the stack. To access the elements of the stack
you use several methods such as push, pop, peak, isEmpty, isFull. An explanation of the them is below:
